        <p>This content has 3 <br><br><br>breaks <br><br> </p>

        <p>This is the <i>italics</i> tag</p>
        <p>This is <em>emphasized</em> </p>
        <p>This is the <b>bold</b> tag</p>
        <p>This is <strong>strong</strong> </p>
        <p>emphasized and strong, look the same as italics and bold but for a screen reader, would realize
        that there is a different style on it, as it won't pick up just bold or italics ->
        notices for people with disabilities, as in it would be read differently <br><br> </p>
