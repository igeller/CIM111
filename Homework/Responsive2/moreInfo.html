                                <p>A service animal is an animal that is trianed to perform
                                tasks for an individual with a disability. These tasks must be
                                directly related to the individual's disability. Service animals
                                are NOT pets.</p>

                                "no pets" policy. However, this is contingent on the fact
                                that the animal wears an identification symbol which is commonly
                                recognized as an indicator of a service animal</p>
