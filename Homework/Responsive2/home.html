                        <p>UPUP is an organization at the University of Miami that aims to spread
                        awareness of service dog training, etiquette, and fraud. Some of our members
                        are CCI puppy raisers, so we are fortunate enough to be able to work with
                        these dogs every week on campus. Our members can learn to become trainers
                        and work one on one with a puppy, help run awareness foucused events and
                        fundraisers, and visit patients in the Lennar Center with out therapy dog.</p>

                            <p>UPup helps begin the the training process for Canine Companions for Indpendence (CCI).
                            CCI was Founded in 1975 as a non-profit organization that enhances the lives of people
                            with disabilities by providing highly trained assistance dogs and ongoing support to
                            ensure quality partnerships.</p>
                            <p>The assistance dogs we breed, raise and train aren’t just the ears, hands and
                            legs of their human partners. They’re also goodwill ambassadors and often, their
                            best friends. They open up new opportunities and new possibilities, and spread
                            incredible joy. We unite people with dogs in a powerful program that leads to
                            greater independence and confidence.</p>
